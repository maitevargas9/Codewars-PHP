All Star Code Challenge #28

You've been annoyed by weather reports one time too many! Celsius...Fahrenheit...why don't they ever give both!?

Create a function called convertCF()/convert_c_f() (depending on language) that accepts 2 arguments, an integer of the 
temperature, and a string of length 1 ("c" or "f") denoting which scale the integer should be converted to (Celsius and 
Fahrenheit, respectively). The function should return a number, which is the conversion from one scale to the other.

By default, the conversion should convert to Celsius if a 2nd argument is not provided; in Python, Ruby and Crystal round 
up to the first digit.

convert_c_f(60, "f"); // => 140
convert_c_f(32, "c"); // => 0
convert_c_f(50); // => 10
convert_c_f(100, "w"); // throw InvalidArgumentException

Note: If the 2nd argument provided is NOT "c" or "f", an error (InvalidArgumentException in PHP) should be thrown. 
The conversion should work with negative numbers, too.
*/

function convert_c_f($num, $scale = 'c') {
  if ($scale === 'c') {
    return ($num - 32) / 9 * 5;
  }
  if ($scale === 'f') {
    return ($num * 9 / 5) + 32;
  }
  throw new InvalidArgumentException; 
}
